AriaX Linux Distribution - Project Overview
===========================================

PROJECT GOAL:
Build a custom Linux distribution with native kernel-level support for Aria's Six-Stream I/O topology.

WHAT IS ARIAX:
AriaX is a specialized Linux distribution designed specifically for the Aria programming language ecosystem. It provides native, kernel-level support for Aria's revolutionary Six-Stream I/O model, extending Unix's traditional 3-stream paradigm (stdin/stdout/stderr) to 6 streams.

THE SIX-STREAM TOPOLOGY:
- FD 0: stdin (Standard Input) - Text input
- FD 1: stdout (Standard Output) - Text/UI output  
- FD 2: stderr (Standard Error) - Error messages
- FD 3: stddbg (Standard Debug) - NEW: Telemetry and diagnostics
- FD 4: stddati (Standard Data In) - NEW: Binary data input
- FD 5: stddato (Standard Data Out) - NEW: Binary data output

THE PROBLEM BEING SOLVED:
Traditional Unix stdout is overloaded with multiple concerns:
- Resultant data
- User interface elements
- Progress indicators
- Debug messages
- Operational logs

This causes the "Noisy Channel" problem where any debug print in a binary pipeline corrupts the data stream, forcing Base64/Hex encoding with significant CPU and bandwidth overhead.

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
1. Modify Linux 6.8 kernel to reserve FDs 3-5 during execve
2. Patch file descriptor allocation to skip reserved FDs
3. Create Bash loadable builtin for extended redirection syntax
4. Build minimal distribution (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base)
5. Integrate Aria toolchain natively

TARGET USERS:
- Aria developers (primary audience)
- System programmers exploring advanced I/O
- Research and academic use
- Production Aria deployments

KEY CHALLENGES:
1. Kernel ABI stability while modifying core structures
2. systemd FD 3 collision (socket activation uses FD 3)
3. Security implications of kernel patches
4. Long-term maintenance burden
5. Hardware compatibility testing

CURRENT STATUS:
- Infrastructure setup complete
- Website live at https://ariax.ai-liberation-platform.org
- Kernel modification specification received (516 lines)
- Planning phase for implementation
